KickstartChain is a personal open-source project on the Rinkeby testnet. This is not for real-life projects.

Create your crowdfunding on the Ethereum Blockchain easily.

I have built the front end with NextJS and chakraUi.

I have built the smart contract with solidity.

With this dapp you can create your crowdfunding make some requests for your campaign and transfer the money only if your contributors agree.

If you wanna use it you must have metamask installed on your browser,
then you must use the rinkeby test Network.
